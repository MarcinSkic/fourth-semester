# Snake for ATMega32
It is compiled using "AVR Studio 4" and tested on software "hapsim" due to lack of microchip in home. Previously tested on ZL3AVR board.
## Finished
- Moving snake ✔️
- Snake becoming longer when eats apple ✔️
- Apple spawning after being eaten ✔️
- Snake detecting collisions with himself ✔️
## Bugs
- Snake sometimes doesn't detect collision when ❌
- Apple sometimes doesn't spawn ❌
## Ideas
- Pick difficulty: snake has different speed
- Snake v2: Body of snake is the size of one pixel on display, and then walls are impassable
